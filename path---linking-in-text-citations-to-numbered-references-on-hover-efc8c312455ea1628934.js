The publisher has no desire to update thousands of online papers by hand either.

Once you have connected the two HTML elements with a set of rules, you may store this relationship to create a reliable way to show the correct tooltip.</p>\n<p>Firstly we must ‘define the relationship’ in verbose terms/rules/exceptions:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Any superscripted text inside the academic paper body is considered to be an ‘in-text citation’, if the text is of the form of:\n  <ul>\n    <li>Digit</li>\n    <li>Digit comma digit …</li>\n    <li>Digit hyphen digit …</li>\n  </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li>Much like a book, where the references come after the citations. The corresponding reference must be appear below the in-text citation on the page</li>\n  <li>The citation must refer to an actual reference on the page</li>\n  <li>The citation must find the closest reference within the same page, since multiple papers can exist on the same page</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Source code</h3>\n<p>For brevity a JavaScript alert is used to show the reference text on hover, please modify this to a tooltip of your liking.</p>\n<iframe width="100%" height="300" src="//jsfiddle.net/1hxg629k/embedded/js,html,result/" allowpaymentrequest allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" frameborder="0"></iframe>',fields:{slug:"/linking-in-text-citations-to-numbered-references-on-hover/",prefix:"2017-10-05"},frontmatter:{title:"Linking in-text citations to numbered references on a page",subTitle:"In this post, we will be adding a usability feature by adding hover functionality to citations.
