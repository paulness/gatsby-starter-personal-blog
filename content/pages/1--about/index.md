## I am a software engineer currently living in NYC.

Originally from Liverpool, England, however, grew up in Perth, Australia. I have a great passion for technology.

#### Python

Understand end-to-end delivery of a commercial Python application

#### APIs

To do my job I have always needed to have a deep understanding of how the API technology at the time worked. I have created/consumed/debugged APIs with the following technologies SOAP, REST and gRPC.

#### CI/CD pipelines

Reliably deploying any application or configuration change is essential to keeping a sane lab. I have set up entire CI/CD pipelines for organizations.

Ownership of an application after it goes live is incredibly important. To try to keep on top of this I have set up dashboards and monitoring with business-friendly metrics for production systems.

Comfortable with using document-based databases such as MongoDB
